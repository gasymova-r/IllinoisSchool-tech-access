# Illinois-School-tech-access
The project uses data from the [Illinois State Board of Education](https://www.isbe.net/Pages/Data-Analysis-Reports.aspx) in an attempt to define which school districts in Illinois experience the most technology accessibility issues and potentially need more funding.

The R Markdown file outputs an HTML file thoroughly describing the analysis (data wrangling, feature engineering, assessment of NAs, variable distributions, etc.).

The final conclusions were made based on two main visualizations:
1. Cleveland Dot Plot demonstrating schools with the highest gap between Internet access demand and supply
2. bar chart showcasing the schools with the lowest number of devices available per student
